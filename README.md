Problem Statement :

The capstone project aims to provide comprehensive insights into e-commerce behaviors and trends through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA). By leveraging cloud-hosted Python notebooks in Jupyter Lab by launching, the scenario includes:
Identify unique product visits and map them to reference channels.
1--Analyze visitor demographics to derive insights into total unique visitors.
2--Determine loyalty periods for targeted marketing strategies based on membership data.
3--Predict key performance indicators such as churn rate and retention rate
4--This comprehensive analysis will empower e-commerce businesses to make data-driven decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive growth.

USP of project :

1--Forecasting can provide several valuable insights, we have  data up to September 2025 and with the help of forecast method  we have  extended our total spend values  upto  to October 2025.

2--Linear Regression for Predicting Total Spent: Utilize a linear regression model to estimate future total spent values based on historical data and relevant predictor variables, ensuring accurate and data-driven financial forecasting.

3--Loyalty period :The project will also determine loyalty periods based on membership data, which is essential for developing targeted marketing strategies aimed at retaining customers.


TASKS :
1--Creating a pipeline to transfer data from one S3 bucket to another using AWS Glue before launching an EMR

2--launched Cluster using AWS EMR ON EC2  and then we started Jupyter notebook workspace to perform Explorative data analysis on Ecommerce Datasets

3--Performed data cleaning and data Analysis based on given scenarios and stored the output back to the S3 storage for further insights and required dashboards .

4--The required insights were visualized with the help of AWS Quick sight and required output of case scenario was accomplished with final report for decision-making as per client requirements.
